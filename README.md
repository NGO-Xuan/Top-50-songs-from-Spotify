# Top-50-songs-from-Spotify
Creating a model to predict the features affecting the ranking of top 50 songs from Spotify (R language).

## 1. Introduction 

In this project, we will analyze the data named `top50.csv`. The dataset displaces the top 50 most listened songs in 2019 in the world by Spotify. It is available at Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/top50spotify2019. Data were stracted from http://organizeyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com/. 

First of all, we find the correlation between each independent variable, such as **Beats.Per.Minute**, **Energy**, **Danceability**, **Loudness.dB.**, **Liveness**, **Valence.**, **Length.**, **Acousticness**, **Speechiness.**, **genre** and the dependent variable **Popularity**.  Secondly, we may think of using appropriate machine Linear Regression to see patterns in the data. To be specific, in this case, we will try with 5 different Simple Linear Regression models and some Multiple Linear Regression models, to see which ones will give us the best model to predict the future music trend. Finally, we will provide some useful recommendations to music producers, composers, and singers to have a good plan for their music using our results.  

## 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE FOLDER:
In the folder R Codes and Files are placed all the files containint the R codes and all the data files. 

## 3. Project status 
We found out the featers that affect the ranking of songs. 
## 4. Work Need to be done
Find out the effective way to clean the data get and  better model. 
## 5. Other information
This is a project that's done by my team, classmate and me


## 5. Updating
I am so happy that I found another updated data of the top songs from Spotify but with 1000 rows. So that I can check my last model. The file is named LargerDataAnalysis-SLRvsMLR.
